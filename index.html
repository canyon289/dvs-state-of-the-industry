                Insights from the Data Visualization: State of the Industry
                Survey 2021 conducted by the
                <a href="https://www.datavisualizationsociety.org/"

            <p>
                This year 2,181 people responded to the survey with their
                demographics, occupation, tools, data visualization focus, time
                spent, and frustrations. The full survey is

                to accomodate their change in routine, living situation, or life
                priorities. Whether it be in-person or remote, onboarding in a
                less social environment could feel pretty lonely. It's difficult
                to meet new people with similar interests. I used this survey
                data to compare people in the workplace and identify groups of
                people that have similar roles, years of experience, and
                industry.
